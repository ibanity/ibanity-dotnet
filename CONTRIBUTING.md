# How to contribute

## Building the project

To build the whole project, you can run `dotnet build .` or just `make` in the root directory. The [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) is required.

If you don't have the .NET SDK installed, you can build the project within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container by running `make docker`.
